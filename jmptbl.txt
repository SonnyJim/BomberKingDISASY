0x0031 - 0x3003C is a 4 byte OAM sprite attributes buffer (Y/Index/attr/X)  
0x0600 - somezie	This is probably for 8x8 sprites
0x0700 - somezie	This is probably for 8x16 sprites



96B9 - 96BA Game state jump table?  I think this looks at the enemy type and then applies a movement pattern to it

X		Jumps to	Effect
0		60e4		Probably not meant to do that.
2		0x98AA		very similar code to 96DD
4		0x9B54/0x993C	more enemy movement
6		0x9B54		enemy movement?
8		0x9BAB		movement
10		0x99F3		
22		0x96DD		Seems to be related to the intro?			



Chalice/level looping
FE9E is a table of chalice/screen loop values.  D5 is always cleared, D2 and D3 are loaded from the table.
FEDC is a table for D4, D5, D6.  D1 seems to be always started at 3
FEE0 is a table for level position?

0x8000 is antother table, NFI what it does though.  Something to do with level data?

FC22 is another one, based around level data + 6 x4?  Uses gfx lobyte/highbyte for something

FCAA results go into 0x8F

FDCC 		PPU RAM lookup table.  List of RAM addresses on the PPU.

8042		2 Sprite lookup tables, populates 87,88,89.  Uses 8042 or 8142 based on the state of the lowest sprite_select but
8142		
8200		another table?  Sprites I think
85AC		SFX lookup table, result goes into 0x152
85D4		SFX jmp table.  Contains the locations of the APU routines to make the various sound effects.
87BB		SFX table?
8D1c		Sprite lookup table?
8D22		Sprite lookup?
8D34		table, nnot sure.  Sprites?
8d37		

9100		Another jump table to be explored
99C5 is a sinusodial lookup table for Y?
9BA2 is another sinusodial table, perhaps for X?
A19F is a movement table? 4 places, 10 FF 00 00?  Directions? 
C8DA		player sprite table?  Something to do with water maybe?		
D040		SFX jmp table.
DAEO	Jump table

FA26		lookup table.  Get's compared to 0x04AE
